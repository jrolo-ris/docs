# Getting an API Key

To use the Video API, you'll need an API key. This key authenticates your requests and identifies your account.

## Obtaining Your API Key

1. Log in to your account at [dashboard.example.com](https://dashboard.example.com)
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **API Keys**
3. Click **Generate New API Key**
4. Give your key a descriptive name (e.g., "Development", "Production")
5. Click **Create**

<Warning>
  Your API key will only be displayed once. Make sure to copy it and store it securely.
</Warning>

## API Key Security

Your API key grants access to your account and resources. Follow these best practices to keep it secure:

- Never expose your API key in client-side code (like JavaScript running in a browser)
- Don't commit your API key to version control systems
- Use environment variables to store your API key in your applications
- Implement proper access controls for who can use your API key
- Rotate your API keys periodically

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `x-api-key` header with all API requests:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.example.com/v1/campaigns" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Node.js Example

```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY; // Store your API key in an environment variable

async function fetchCampaigns() {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get('https://api.example.com/v1/campaigns', {
      headers: {
        'x-api-key': apiKey
      }
    });
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching campaigns:', error);
  }
}
```

### Python Example

```python
import requests
import os

api_key = os.environ.get('API_KEY')  # Store your API key in an environment variable

def fetch_campaigns():
    headers = {
        'x-api-key': api_key
    }
    response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/v1/campaigns', headers=headers)
    response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for 4XX/5XX responses
    return response.json()
```

## Managing API Keys

You can manage your API keys from the dashboard:

- **View** your active API keys
- **Create** new API keys
- **Revoke** existing API keys if they're compromised
- **Monitor** API key usage and activity

<Note>
  We recommend creating separate API keys for different environments (development, staging, production) and different applications.
