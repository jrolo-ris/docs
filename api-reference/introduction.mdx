# Video API Introduction

Welcome to the Video API documentation. This API allows you to programmatically create personalized videos, manage campaigns, track analytics, and more.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to the following base URL:

```
https://api.example.com/v1
```

## Authentication

The Video API uses API keys for authentication. All API requests must include your API key in the `x-api-key` header.

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.example.com/v1/campaigns" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

<Note>
  Keep your API key secure and never share it publicly. If you believe your API key has been compromised, you should regenerate it immediately from your dashboard.
</Note>

## Rate Limiting

The API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage and system stability. The current limits are:

- 100 requests per minute per API key
- 5,000 requests per day per API key

If you exceed these limits, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

## Response Format

All API responses are returned in JSON format. Successful responses will have a 2xx status code and contain the requested data. Error responses will have a 4xx or 5xx status code and include an error message.

### Success Response Example

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    // Response data here
  }
}
```

### Error Response Example

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "invalid_request",
    "message": "The request was invalid",
    "details": "Missing required parameter: campaignId"
  }
}
```

## API Endpoints

The API is organized around the following resources:

- **Campaigns**: Create and manage video campaigns
- **Analytics**: Track video views and viewer information
- **Company**: Manage company settings and credits
