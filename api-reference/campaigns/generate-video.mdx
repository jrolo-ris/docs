## Description

Initiates the generation of a video for a specific campaign. This endpoint queues a video render job and returns information about the created video.

<Note>

- The `fields` array must match the expected fields for the campaign's template.
- The `callback_url` will be called when the video rendering is complete.
- The `thumbnail` parameter is optional; if omitted, it defaults to 1.5 seconds.
